## Overview

This repository serves as a personal log of my journey through LeetCode, where I continuously work to improve my problem-solving skills. You'll find solutions written in multiple programming languages, with a focus on Python and C++. Each problem is clearly categorized by its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and topic (e.g., Arrays, Stack, Hash Tables, LL, BST).

## Goals

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:** By consistently solving problems, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving abilities and prepare for technical interviews.
- **Master Data Structures and Algorithms:** This collection helps me to deepen my understanding of key data structures and algorithms, which are crucial for coding interviews.
- **Document Learning:** I use this repository to document my thought process and the different approaches I take to solve each problem.

## Structure

Each problem's solution is stored in a separate file, with the following structure:

- **Problem Description:** A brief summary of the problem, along with a link to the original LeetCode problem.
- **Approach:** Explanation of the approach taken to solve the problem.
- **Solution:** The code implementation, optimized for efficiency.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions, and if you're working on a similar problem, you might find different perspectives or techniques that can help you.
